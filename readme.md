- Download media file


## Project Architecture

The Project mainly contains two modules
- Warehouses
    - Contains warehouse address and contact information
    - Contains count of total inventory items present in warehouse
- Inventory Items
    - Contains Item information
    - Contains warehouse information, where it is stored
    - Contains status of inventory item: (Received, Off-Loaded, Ready to Ship)

#### DB architecture:
<img src="assets/db-diagram.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

## Replit Quick Setup

![image logo](assets/replit-flow-2.gif)

### Step 1:

Import the repository in replit

https://github.com/nischay-dhiman/media-convertor

### Step 2:

In shell section of replit, run following command

```sh
bundle
```

### Step 3:

Creating the Database defined in database.yml for developement and test environments

```sh
rails db:create
```

### Step 4:

Migrating the tables

```sh
rails db:migrate
```

### Step 5:

Seed the warehouse table with two warehouses

```sh
rails db:seed
```

### Step 6:

Run the rails server with binding on 0.0.0.0 for replit

```sh
rails s -b 0.0.0.0
```

After this, we can check on the replit preview window for demo.

## Local Machine Setup

### Step 1:
##### Ruby Installation

You may have ruby preinstalled. To verify Ruby Installation, Run:
```sh
ruby -v
```
If not, follow this [link](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) to install ruby for various OS.
### Step 2:
##### SQLite Installation:

Many popular UNIX-like OSes ship with an acceptable version of SQLite3. 
On Windows, if you installed Rails through Rails Installer, you already have SQLite installed. 
Others can find installation instructions at the [SQLite3 website](https://www.sqlite.org/). 

To Verify that it is correctly installed and in your PATH:
```sh
sqlite3 --version
```

### Step 3
##### Rails Installation

We need the current latest version of rails.

```sh
gem install rails --version '7.0.3'
rails --version
```

Kindly follow the official Rails installation documentation in case of any issues:
[https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html)


### Step 4:
Cloning the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nischay-dhiman/dhiman_logistics.git
cd dhiman_logistics
```

### Step 5:
Installing all the gems libraries and dependencies
```sh
bundle
```

### Step 6:
Creating the database and migrating for the first time
```sh
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
```

### Step 7:
Running the Rails server on local
```sh
rails s
```
We can check website on our local machine browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
We should see something like this in the browser:

## Running Testcases

Added around 26 test cases majorly covering model level validations, callbacks

```sh
bundle exec rspec
```
  
## Future Scope  
- Add Authentication
